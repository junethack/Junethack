The Secret History of Junethack
===============================
Somewhen in late 2010, the original idea of conducting a NetHack tournament in
June came to Casmith789 "Let's have a tournament in June!", only, it wasn't
that original as others had that idea before.

The only original bit of allowing NetHack Variants into the tournament
caught Kerio's eyes and he began using exquisite marketing techniques usually
commonly known as "trolling" to gather likewise minded people. Despite that Stenno made the
first commit in May 2011 and Adeon provided first design sketches, shortly
after that joined by Xiella, while Rawrmage provided server space.

When Junethack was running late, Bhaak rushed it and single handedly saved
Junethack, NetHack, and the world while NetHack players all over the net gasped at
his programming skillz awesomenessness and then he went on to maintain
Junethack for the next 50 years.
