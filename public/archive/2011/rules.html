                No cheating on game servers account registered to the tournament
                (examples of cheating include hacking a server to add fake games,
                abusing PRNG vulnerabilities to predict the future state of a game,
                exploiting memory-corrupting bugs). If we catch you, we'll disqualify
                you. However, we don't consider some things such as pudding farming
                or bones stuffing to be cheating. Use common sense.
              </p>

                For this tournament,
                <a href='http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Start_scumming'>start scumming games</a>
                are defined as games where the player escapes or quits within the first 10
                turns. Such games are hidden on the games tables but are otherwise treated like
                normal games.
              </p>
              <p>
                Streaks are sequences of non-overlapping games played on a single
                game server account, with no games in-between.
              </p>
              <div class='text_content non_top_post'></div>
              <p>
                The score for competitions and clan competitions is calculated as
                follows:
                <p>
                  <li>
                    Only the best game for each player is considered, for each
                    category.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The first place player(s) get 4 points, the second place
                    player(s) get 3 points, the third place player(s) get 2 points,
                    and the remaining players get points according to the ratio
                    of their best evaluated game to the winner(s)' best evaluated
                    game.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In case of a tie, all the players with the same evaluation get
                    the same amount of points; in the ranking, they're considered
                    as one player.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Games with negative scores are discarded for the "lowest scoring
                    ascension" competition.
                  </li>
                </p>
              </p>
              <div class='text_content non_top_post'></div>
              <p>
                The score for trophies is fixed - one point for each trophy;
                streak trophies are separate from their standard counterpart,
                the requirement for those is that all the requirements for the
                trophy are fulfilled in a sequence of ascensions on a single
                game server account.
                Achievement trophies yield equal fractions of a point according
                to how many achievements were obtained in the whole tournament.
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Cross-variant trophies exclude NetHack 1.3d; the "Sightseeing
                Tour" trophy requires a game from each variant to be played for at
                least 1000 turns, or to finish with an ascension; the "Globetrotter"
                trophy doesn't require a full trophy for each variant - a single
                achievement out of the set for each variant is enough.
              </p>
              <p>
                The "No membership card" and "Too good for a brain" trophies are
                UnNetHack-specific.
