          Each player of a clan contributes to the total clan score.
          Clans are ranked according to clan score.
        %p
          First place is awarded 4 points, second place is awarded 3,
          2 for third place. The remaining clans get points according
          to the ratio of their best evaluated score to the winner clan's best
          evaluated score.
        %p
          In case of a tie, all clans with the same evaluation get
          the same amount of points; in the ranking, they're considered
          as one clan.
